# SUSTech-CourseGrabber
A tool for you to grab desired course in the second round of course selection using Python.

Everything you need to configure is in the Configuration part:
  1. class_id : a 2-d array, with the first element being the ID of the class and the second one being the name you wish to call the course.
  2. userId & password: fill in with your student account info (No storage of private info at all!)
  3. At present, there is no need to change jwxtCASUrl and jrxkUrl2,which are listed just in case of future changes
